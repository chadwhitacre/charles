"""Automatically restart a program on SystemExit or when certain files.

This module solves the problem of refreshing modules in memory when the source
files change. There are two basic ways to solve this problem:

    1. Reload modules within a single process
    -----------------------------------------

    The basic trick is to delete items from sys.modules, forcing a refresh the
    next time they are loaded. This gets tough because imported modules depend
    on each other. Look at Zope and RollbackImporter for two implementations.


    2. Maintain two processes
    -------------------------

    In this solution, a parent process continuously restarts a child process.
    This gets around module import dependencies, but the downside is that you
    loose any program state on restart, and it magnifies the shutdown/start-up
    time of your program.


This module implements the second solution, automatically watching source files
for all loaded modules (with the exception of those imported directly from a
ZIP archive via zipimport). Employing a process boundary means this module can
also be used for server thrashing. We can also watch non-source files, such as
configuration files. This module provides the following members:

    CHILD, PARENT       These are booleans indicating whether the current
                        process is the parent or child.

    loop                Continuously relaunch the current program in a sub-
                        process until the exit code is something other than 75.

    should_restart      Return a boolean indicating whether the child process
                        should be restarted. If called in the parent process,
                        it always returns False. If you don't call monitor_
                        filesystem first, it always returns True.

    watch(filepath)     Add <filepath> to the list of non-source files to watch.
                        If the file is removed or has its modtime changed, the
                        program will restart.

    monitor_filesystem()  Turn on a thread that monitors filesystem activity,
                        restarting the server if watched files or module files
                        change.


Our implementation uses a thread in the child process to monitor all library
source files as well as those added with watch. Your program is responsible for
periodically calling should_restart, exiting with code 75 whenever it returns
True (presumably after cleanly shutting down). Exit code 75 seems appropriate
because of its meaning on Unix systems.  E.g., from FreeBSD 6.1-RELEASE,
/usr/include/sysexits.h:

    EX_TEMPFAIL -- temporary failure, indicating something that
    *              is not really an error.  In sendmail, this means
    *              that a mailer (e.g.) could not create a connection,
    *              and the request should be reattempted later.
    [...]
    #define EX_TEMPFAIL     75      /* temp failure; user is invited to retry */

    -- /usr/include/sysexits.h, FreeBSD 6.1-RELEASE


A modified file dependency is "not really an error," and the parent process is
"invited to retry" launching the child program.

Here's an example of what this looks like:

    import restarter
    import foo # your module; change to trigger reloading

    def main():
        # startup code here
        restarter.watch('foo.conf') # your conf file; change to trigger
                                    # reloading
        while 1:
            # program logic here
            if restarter.should_restart():
                # shutdown code here
                print "restarting ..."
                raise SystemExit(75)

    if restarter.PARENT:
        restarter.loop()
    else:
        restarter.monitor_filesystem()
        main()


This module requires the subprocess module. Included in the standard library
since Python 2.4, it can also be found here:

#   http://timgolden.me.uk/pywin32-docs/win32event.html

# all on Windows right now. Instead, we'll eventually integrate with the
